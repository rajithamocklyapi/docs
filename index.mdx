## Setting up

MocklyAPI is an AI-assisted SaaS app for creating mock APIs. Generate realistic data using chat prompts, organize it into projects within organizations, and access it via secure endpoints.
Ideal for testing and development, it keeps endpoints private by default, supports bringing your own data, and lets you get started quickly to build you next big thing.
