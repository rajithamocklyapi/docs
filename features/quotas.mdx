- Whitespace and formatting characters
- Special characters and unicode

### AI Assistant Message Limits

The AI Assistant helps you generate and refine mock data with intelligent suggestions.

- This is the maximum length of each message you send to the AI assistant
- Applies to your prompts and questions

**Monthly Message Quota:** 100 messages per month
- Resets on the first day of each calendar month

### HTTP Endpoint Rate Limiting

To ensure service stability and fair usage, mock API endpoints have the following limits:

**Rate Limit:** 100 requests per minute
- Applied per mock API endpoint
- Requests exceeding this limit receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response

**Monthly Request Quota:** 50,000 requests per month
- Applied per mock API endpoint
- Resets on the first day of each calendar month
- Only successful requests count toward this quota


### Projects and Organizations

**Projects per Organization:** 3 projects
- Each organization can create up to 3 projects

**Free Organizations per User:** 2 organizations
- Each user account can create or own up to 2 free organizations

## Request Counting Rules

<Info>
  **Only successful requests count toward your monthly quota.** Failed or rejected requests do not consume your allocation.
</Info>

### Requests That Count

✅ Successful requests that count toward quota:
- `200 OK` responses
- `201 Created` responses

### Requests That Don't Count

❌ The following requests are **excluded** from your quota:
- **Unauthorized requests** - `401 Unauthorized` responses (invalid or missing auth tokens)
- **Rate limited requests** - `429 Too Many Requests` responses (exceeded rate limit)
- **Server errors** - `5xx` responses (service unavailability or internal errors)
- **Client errors** - `4xx` responses other than 429 which are not explicitly set using settings (malformed requests)

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Development Testing**
```bash
# 100 requests with valid auth token → 100 successful responses
# Quota consumed: 100 requests
```

**Scenario 2: Invalid Authentication**
```bash
# 50 requests with invalid auth token → 50 unauthorized responses (401)
# Quota consumed: 0 requests
```

**Scenario 3: Rate Limit Hit**
```bash
# 150 requests in one minute
# - First 100 requests: successful (200)
# - Next 50 requests: rate limited (429)
# Quota consumed: 100 requests
```

**Scenario 4: Mixed Results**
```bash
# 1000 total requests:
# - 900 successful (200)
# - 50 unauthorized (401)
# - 50 rate limited (429)
# Quota consumed: 900 requests
```

## Fair Use Policy

MocklyAPI is provided free of charge during early access. We ask that users:

- Use the service for legitimate development and testing purposes
- Avoid automated abuse or excessive traffic generation
- Report bugs and provide feedback to help improve the platform

Violating the fair use policy may result in account suspension.
