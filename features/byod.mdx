MocklyAPI allows you to utilize your own data independently of the AI chat feature. This is particularly beneficial when you already have a prepared dataset. 

You also have the flexibility to modify AI-generated data to suit your specific requirements.

To enable the BYOD feature, toggle it on the editor page. This will activate the code editor, allowing you to make adjustments.
